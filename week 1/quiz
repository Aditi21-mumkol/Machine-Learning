1.Question 1
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with

          respect to some task T and some performance measure P if its

          performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

          Suppose we feed a learning algorithm a lot of historical weather

          data, and have it learn to predict weather. What would be a

          reasonable choice for P?

ANSWER

2.Suppose you are working on weather prediction, and use a

          learning algorithm to predict tomorrow's temperature (in

          degrees Centigrade/Fahrenheit).

          Would you treat this as a classification or a regression problem?
          
 3. Suppose you are working on stock market prediction.  You would like to predict whether or not a certain company will win a patent infringement lawsuit 
 (by training on data of companies that had to defend against similar lawsuits).  Would you treat this as a classification or a regression problem?
 4. Some of the problems below are best addressed using a supervised

          learning algorithm, and the others with an unsupervised

          learning algorithm.  Which of the following would you apply

          supervised learning to?  (Select all that apply.) In each case, assume some appropriate

          dataset is available for your algorithm to learn from.
5. Which of these is a reasonable definition of machine learning?
